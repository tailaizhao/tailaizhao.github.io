<p>Riptide-Vance Joy parody - Potato Party 
by Tailai
I was scared of starch and fatty foods
I was scared of random stuff and things with lots of fructose
Oh all my friends are turning slim
And I’m getting addicted to random things
Aooooooh oooh oooh
Aoooooh oh oh
And the burgers come
Chorus:
I am
Feasting on the potatoes
Extras go to the market
Potatoes are my favorite snack
You can make chips
Eat them like you’re crazy
I always pile my plate up
Tons of ways to eat em’ up
Here’s this burger I think that you’ll like
It’s full of cheese and sauce that mixes perfectly with butter
I’ve been eating all my fridge’s stuff
And I’ve been living on the burger sauce
Aooooooh oooh oooh
Aoooooh oh oh
And the burgers come
Chorus 2:
Tacos
Falling down like raindrops
Pack them all in your mouth, yeah
Feast on tacos day and night
Serve em’
At some beaches and parties
All you hear is the crunching
Of the tacos everywhere
I just wanna
I just wanna feast
If you’re also
If you’re hungry too
I just gotta
I just gotta feast
If you’re also
If you’re also hungry too
I swear that burger’s destined for his dreams
Wants to be eaten by a celebrity, oh
I am
Feasting on the potatoes
Extras go to the market
Potatoes are my favorite snack
You can make chips
Devour them like you’re crazy
I always pile my plate up
Tons of ways to eat em’ up
Oh, Tacos
Falling down like raindrops
Pack them all in your mouth, yeah
Feast on tacos day and night
Serve em’
At some beaches and parties
All you hear is the crunching
Of the tacos everywhere
Oh, I am
Feasting on the potatoes
Extras go to the market
Potatoes are my favorite snack
You can make chips
Devour them like you’re crazy
I always pile my plate up
Tons of ways to eat em’ up</p>
